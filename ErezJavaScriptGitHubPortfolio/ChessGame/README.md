Hello everyone!

Over the past 2 years since i started my full-stack dev journey, I realized that learning the basics including HTML, CSS, and Javascript (JS) are almost essential for web-dev and blockchain related projects.  I came across Freecodecamp which has been an amazing resource and have gone through their free course learning HTML, CSS, and now JS.  

I felt that my level of coding is now ready for a challenge project.  I was inspired by my kids who are learning chess in an afterschool chess class, and I thought to myself, "Wouldn't it be cool to program a chess game using the holy trio mentioned above?"  I searched on youtube for a chess tutorial in JS and up popped the lovely Ania Kubów with her "♟️ Code CHESS in JavaScript (Super simple!)".  You can watch it here and code along with her as well: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv0fvm5B0EM&t=3362s"  

Sometime I get "shpilkes" and have a hard time sitting still, so I have even begun what I like to think of as "blind coding" or "fitness coding" in which I listen to the dev and code along in my mind visualising what they are talking about, absorbing all of the terms, concepts ideas while I'm out for a jog, training at the gym, or driving.  

So this is my first "big coding project" in HTML/CSS/JS and I have spent at least 20 hours on this project, which has really led me to grow as a dev forcing me to even improve my Git/Github skills, which up to this point had been a bit of an uphill battle and much frustration (I had to take some time away from the project to watch some github tutorials/get lost in the CLI but ultimately I got things to work, this is a good one: https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk?si=92sWmxJ_pHM_redo)  

I also want to give a major shoutout to Freecodecamp especially the moderator named ILM who has been an essential part of this project for me, helping everytime I got stuck and pushing me gently onwards, you can see our back and forth dialog here: https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/code-chess-in-javascript-super-simple/725188

And thanks to Gimbalabs livecoding sessions for giving me a community to learn with and grow with together on so many levels, and for Newman suggesting that I write this README.md file in the firstplace and explore content creation via Loom, which is a tool I have been wondering about for the past few years but never new how to find it, and to be honest was a bit timid about immersing myself in, let's just say there are moments where I feel intensly camera shy, but I'm working on overcoming that.

I'm still not done yet with the code and I don't understand everything yet going on under the hood but I'm getting there and I feel that this project has been a major milestone and accomplishment for me.
