The brown and Beige is funny.  I asked a friend and they said - Here are some creative and descriptive names for the colors you provided:

    #a92b2b – Crimson Ember or Deep Rust
    (A bold, deep red with warm undertones, reminiscent of glowing embers or aged brick.)

    #6e6e62 – Stone Grey or Aged Pewter
    (A muted, earthy grey with subtle greenish hues, similar to weathered stone or aged metal.)


I love the firstChild? ... oh, I bet the ? means "if it exists, then..." 

One VSCode thing:  When you do a find and get a bunch of selected words, ...To select the next piece of text in Visual Studio Code, you can use the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl+D` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+D` (Mac). This will select the next occurrence of the currently selected text.  I used it to change 'startPiece' to 'currentPiece'.

That's it for today.  I'll push these changes and perhaps do a merge request / pull request
